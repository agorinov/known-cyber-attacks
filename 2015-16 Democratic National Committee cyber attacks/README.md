# 2015-16 Democratic National Committee cyber attacks

## Who was attacked

The 2015-2016 DNC cyber attacks targetted various members of the Democratic National Committee, including Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, as well as the members of the Republican National Committee, although information obtained from the RNC was not leaked.   

## Negative impact of attack

One negative impact of the attack was release of controversial emails from the Democratic Party's national committee. These emails revealed that the committee favoured Hillary Clinton over her rival, Bernie Sanders, a fact that may have negatively affected Hillary Clinton's chance in the 2016 election, leading to Donald Trump winning becoming president.
