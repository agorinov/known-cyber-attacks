# 2015-16 Democratic National Committee cyber attacks

## Who was attacked

The 2015-2016 DNC cyber attacks targetted various members of the Democratic National Committee, including Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman. Members of the Republican National Committee were also hacked, although information obtained from the RNC was not leaked.   

## Negative impact of attack

As part of the breach, confidential emails and chat messages between DNC members were stolen and later leaked. Some of the emails revealed that the committee favoured Hillary Clinton over her rival, Bernie Sanders. This may have negatively affected Hillary Clinton's chance in the 2016 election, likely leading to Donald Trump winning the presidential race.   

## Attack agent

Two Russian state-sponsored groups, nicknamed Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear, are believed to have carried out the attacks. Although neither group seemed to be aware of the other, both used similar high-level tools and techniques.   

## STRIDE model

Spoofing - Spearfishing emails were used to gain access to DNC Chairman John Podesta's email account [1]

Tampering - Cozy Bear launched malicious code via an obfuscated PowerShell script. 

Information Disclosure - Confidential emails from John Podesta's account were accessed and released through WikiLeaks.  

Elevation of Privilege: Fancy Bear enabled distant command execution, transmission of files, and keylogging using X Agent and X-Tunnel Malware.
